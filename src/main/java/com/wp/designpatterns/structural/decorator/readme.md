There is an angry troll living in the nearby hills. Usually it goes bare handed but sometimes it has a weapon. To arm the troll it's not necessary to create a new troll but to decorate it dynamically with a suitable weapon.

附近的山上有一个愤怒的巨魔。通常它是裸手但有时它有武器。为了武装巨魔，没有必要创造一个新的巨魔，但用合适的武器动态装饰它。

## Applicability ##
Use Decorator

* To add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently, that is, without affecting other objects  动态且透明地向各个对象添加职责，即不影响其他对象
* For responsibilities that can be withdrawn  对于可以撤回的责任
* When extension by subclassing is impractical. Sometimes a large number of independent extensions are possible and would produce an explosion of subclasses to support every combination. Or a class definition may be hidden or otherwise unavailable for subclassing  通过子类扩展是不切实际的。有时可能会有大量独立扩展，并会产生大量子类以支持每种组合。或者类定义可能隐藏或以其他方式不可用于子类化
