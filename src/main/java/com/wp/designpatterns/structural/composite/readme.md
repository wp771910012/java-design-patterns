Every sentence is composed of words which are in turn composed of characters. Each of these objects is printable and they can have something printed before or after them like sentence always ends with full stop and word always has space before it

每个句子都由单词组成，而单词又由字符组成。这些对象中的每一个都是可打印的，并且它们可以在它们之前或之后打印一些内容，例如句子总是以句号结束并且字总是在它之前有空格

## Applicability ##
Use the Composite pattern when:

* you want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects  您想要表示对象的部分整体层次结构
* you want clients to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects. Clients will treat all objects in the composite structure uniformly  
您希望客户能够忽略对象组合和单个对象之间的差异。客户端将统一处理复合结构中的所有对象
